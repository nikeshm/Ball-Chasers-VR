## Getting Started

If you have the Unity3D editor installed on your computer (versions 5, 2017, 2018, or 2019), then you can run the MainScene.unity file on your own machine. Download the latest version of Unity [here](https://unity.com/releases/2019-2)


## Notes

You'll need the version of Google VR included in this project to ensure; after the deprecation of GVR by Google, newer versions you find may not work very well

## Permissions

All the assets and game scripts here were developed by me.
