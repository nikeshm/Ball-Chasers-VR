## Getting Started

If you have the Unity3D editor installed on your computer (versions 5, 2017, 2018, or 2019), then you can run the MainScene.unity file on your own machine. Download the latest version of Unity from the official website [here](https://unity.com/releases/2019-2).

## Notes

This game works without any Google plugins, but you can add Google VR to monitor yourself in the virtual environment; the meta file is provided here for your conviencence, so you need only add GVR to your Unity assets after downloading this project.

The .meta files aren't interesting to look at, but are necessary to run the game in the Unity editor.
